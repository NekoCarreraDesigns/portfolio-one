I am a web developer. I am creative to the bone, having an interest in the arts as a child, I grew to love design, and enjoy the creative process.
      From the idea stage to the finished project, weither it was drawing, painting, building, I found myself lost in a world of possibilities. Where the outcome was fully realized, 
      the vision came to life and flourished. My work ethic is that of the blue collar worker, putting in maximum effort, to achieve my goals. getting results in the alloted time, and delivering 
      the highest quality product, available for immediate use. With the user experience in mind, along with a design thats guaranteed to turn heads.</p>

     <p>Neko Carrera has only been around a short time in the developer community. He has made a few websites worthy of your attention.
        Such classics as the Go Fudge Yourself web page, An art website for the Lakota Sioux commune in Rapid City, and various other commercial websites.
        As well as personal websites for friends, and family members. I love what I do, so don't be afraid to contact me with your project. 
        Every project no matter how big or small will get my full attention, so that you will be satisfied with the finished project. For a detailed view 
        of the projects I have created, check out my portfolio page.
